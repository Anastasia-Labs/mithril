# Milestone Report #1

This document is a summary of the situation of the Mithril project as of January 2022. It aims at providing a comprehensive overview of:
  *  What's been done,
  *  What conclusions we can draw from the various efforts undertaken,
  *  What open questions remain, and
  *  What could be the next steps.

# Code

## Mithril library

* Mithril core library has been developed mainly by Galois through September and October 2021 (last commit from `abakst@galois.com` is from November 2).
  * The library weighs in at about 25K LOC
* Development has been monitored closely by IÃ±igo and Pyrros who reviewed all PRs and also provided significant contributions in particular to provide some polishing on:
  * Unit and integration tests
  * C API,
* The library exposes a C API for all its features and data structures allowing client code to manage the whole protocol. It is built and packaged as a dynamically linked `libmithril.so` which can then linked against by thirdparty code. It's been tested with Go when developing the Mithril node
* The library is throughly tested thanks to:
  * A large set of unit and property-based tests for individual functions and features (code coverage is 68.36%, with 903/1321 lines covered)
  * Integration tests demonstrating the full protocol in Rust,
  * C tests using [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) checking C API and integration with the core Rust library,
  * Tests are run in the [Continuous Integration](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) process, both for Rust, C and Go parts,
* It is lacking user-facing "Get started" style documentation but the code is properly documented and the [examples/](../rust/examples) directory contains several detailed examples covering the major use cases for the library.
  * Documentation of the library is published [online](https://input-output-hk.github.io/mithril/mithril/)
* Library also contains implementation of [Ad-hoc Threshold Multi Signatures](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/blob/main/rust/examples/atms.rs#L1) for use in Sidechains. This code should be separated from the Mithril core and become part of another library.
* The library is single-threaded, no effort has been put into parallelizing any of the protocol's operations. However, the protocol's state is maintained in data structures that share nothing (eg. _objects_) so parallelisation is trvially achievable by duplicating data and running signing or other functions
  * Proper parallelisation assessment still needs to be done in order to understand how the library can scale
* The library comes with some micro-benchmarks for the various atomic operations provided.
  * The most expensive operation is the key registration process which is done only once, to setup the protocol's state.
  * Signature verification for 256 signers takes on average 3.6ms

## Go Node

* A Mithril node has been developed by Idyllic Vision in Go
  * It's about 3K LOC
* This node was intended as a _Proof-of-Concept_ development to validate the feasability of running Mithril (full) node as a separate (Layer 2) solution. As such, the goal of this development was to demonstrate the Mithril library can be used by something else than cardano-node to produce signed certificates for some realistically sized UTXO set
* The target architecture has been documented in the [Mithril Network](./mithril-network.md) document
* The actual implementation has the following features:
  * The signature generation process is _leader-based_: The signing process is initiated by a leader that creates a message to sign and requests signatures from the other participants, then aggregates the result and broadcast again the resulting certificates
  * The data is retrieved from a [db-sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) populated [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database instance (data is extracted from a Testnet)
  * The Mithril nodes uses the same DB to store the produced certificates
  * The key generation and key registration process is handled in the Rust library but the whole configured signing _Clerk_ can be serialised on disk so that node can start from a known configuration
  * The stakes distribution is statically defined in a configuration file and does not change over the life of the nodes
  * The node exposes a classical REST API that allows clients to retrieve certificates, certificate chains and associated data, eg. the UTXO
  * UTXO are stored in a Merkle Tree and can be retrieved individually along with associated proof. The certificate signs only the root of the Merkle Tree, thus minimising the amount of data clients have to process to validate them

### Performance

* At this stage it was not deemed necessary to setup a full blown performance analysis of the nodes
* Basic benchmarks run have shown that a node can produce an aggregate multisignature for 10 M UTXO in 3'45''
  * About half of this execution time is spent querying and retrieving the data from the DB
* There has been no attempt so far at scaling the number of nodes but given what we know from the behaviour of the library, it's pretty clear the limiting factor will be the network protocol

# Use Cases

* In parallel with PoC development we have been working with Product Dpt on the use cases for Mithril in order to understand what a path to productisation could look like.
  * The Lightwallet workshop that occured early November was an opportunity to better understand the Lightwallet requirements for Mithril, eg. enabling fast and trustless bootstrap of wallets
  * We conducted a series of [Story Mapping](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/) sessions from November 2021 until early January 2022 in order to delve into some use cases in more details. These sessions were framed in the context of implementing Mithril for fast bootstrapping of Daedalus.
