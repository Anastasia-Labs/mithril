The Mithril team has published a [security advisory](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/security/advisories/GHSA-9m3h-72xj-x2gq) to destination of SPOs running a Mithril signer/relay on the `mainnet` infrastructure:

- **Location**: https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/security/advisories/GHSA-9m3h-72xj-x2gq

We strongly encourage all the `mainnet` SPOs to update the listening port of their **Mithril relay** in order to prevent the issue, with the process explained in the **Workarounds** section of the [security advisory](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/security/advisories/GHSA-9m3h-72xj-x2gq).
