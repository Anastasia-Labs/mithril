### Certification of Cardano transactions

:::info

A threshold of at least **75%** of the stake running version `0.2.182` (within **10** days after the distribution `2437` is released) is mandatory in order to activate the certification of the Cardano transactions on the `release-mainnet` network.

The [Mithril Protocol Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8b05ea4b-6a43-45ea-aef2-237906ec7a42?s=oi6CR5eZrnQ) dashboard displays the adoption rate of the different signer versions on the `release-mainnet` network.

:::

With the release of the new distribution [2430](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2430.0), we have started to roll-out the certification of the **Cardano transactions** in the Mithril networks.
