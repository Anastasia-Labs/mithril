### Certification of Cardano transactions

With the release of the new distribution [2430](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2430.0), we have started to roll-out the certification of the **Cardano transactions** in the Mithril networks.

  - [x] Activation of the certification of **Cardano transactions** in the `pre-release-preview` network.
  - [x] Activation of the certification of **Cardano transactions** in the `release-preprod` network.
- [ ] Distribution `2434` (after the **Chang** hardfork):
  - [ ] Activation of the certification of **Cardano transactions** in the `release-mainnet` network.
