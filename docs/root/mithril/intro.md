# About Mithril

:::info New

:new: Interact with the **Mithril Simulation** by experiencing with our [protocol demo](mithril-simulation.md). This will help you understand how the participants interact to create a multi signature and what's the impact of the protocol parameters.

## Mithril in a nutshell

**Mithril** is a research project which goal is to provide [Stake-based Threshold Multisignatures](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithrilstake-based-threshold-multisignatures/) on top of the **Cardano Network**.

In a nutshell, **Mithril** can be summarized as:

> A protocol that allows **stakeholders** in a **Proof-of-Stake** blockchain network to individually **sign messages** that are aggregated into a **multi signature** which guarantees that they represent a minimum share of the total stakes.

In other words, an adversarial participant with less than this share of the total stakes will not be able to produce valid multi signatures :closed_lock_with_key:.
