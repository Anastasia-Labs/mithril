# Documentation

Welcome to Mithril documentation.

Mithril is the implementation of Mithril Stake-based Threshold Multisignature [research publication](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/916.pdf). This project uses Mithril multisignature keys to create certified savepoints (aka snapshots) in the Cardano Blockchain in order to speed up Wallets synchronizations.

 * [How does it work](./core-concepts/mithril-protocol.md)?


    It might be interesting here to identify and place links to what user would
    like the most to do (identify use cases? how it works? install software? etc.)
