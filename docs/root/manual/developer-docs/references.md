## REST API References

* [**Mithril Aggregator - API Reference** :link:](/aggregator-api):

> the node of the **Mithril Network** responsible for collecting individual signatures from the **Mithril Signers** and aggregate them into a multisignature. The **Mithril Aggregator** uses this ability to provide certified snapshots of the **Cardano** blockchain.

## Rust Dependencies References
