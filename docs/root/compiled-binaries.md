## Download compiled binary

Each Release / Pre-Release distribution comes with pre compiled binaries ready to use or wrapped in a debian package.

You can download them from the Release / Pre-Release distribution page that depends on the Mithril Network you are targeting.

These links are available in the **Build From** column of the above **Mithril Networks** table.
