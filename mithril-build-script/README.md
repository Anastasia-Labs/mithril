# Mithril-build-script

A toolbox for Mithril crates that need a [build scripts phase](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html).

Moreover, this crate allows to test the build scripts, which is not supported directly in `build.rs` (see: [rust-lang/cargo#1581](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1581)).
